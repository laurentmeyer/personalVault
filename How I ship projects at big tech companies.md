no matter the project goal, your leadership team (the people in your reporting chain who care about the project) will always have basically zero technical context about the project compared to you. That means they will be trusting you for estimates, to answer technical questions, and to anticipate technical problems. Maintaining that trust should be your top priority. If they don’t have faith in your ability to do the job and to keep them informed, you will not ship. They’ll de-risk by cancelling the project, or letting it roll out with zero attention or celebration (remember that an un-celebrated launch is not a ship!)

How do you maintain trust with your leadership team? This could be a whole article (or book) by itself, but here’s my summary:

- The best thing is a track record of having shipped in the past, if you can get it
- Project confidence (if you’re visibly worried, they will be too)
- Project competence. You want to aim for something like a NASA mission control vibe
- Communicate professionally and concisely, and don’t make them chase you for updates: post a daily or weekly thread somewhere

It is much, much more important to do these things than for the project to ship with zero bugs on the exact deadline. If a project has to be delayed for technical reasons, in my experience you will not suffer consequences so long as you communicate it clearly, confidently (and ideally with some warning). In fact, it’s paradoxically often better for you if there is some kind of problem that forces a delay, for the same reason that the heroic on-call engineer who hotfixes an incident gets more credit than the careful engineer who prevents one.

Remember, your main priority is maintaining trust with your leadership team. Nothing builds trust like having fallback plans, because in case of emergency fallback plans indicate control over the situation. If the worst does happen and you can’t release on the day, your manager will be much happier going to their manager about it if they can say something like “our options are to delay four days, or ship tomorrow by sacrificing X” - even if sacrificing X is a non-starter. That means they’ll be more likely to interpret the delay as an unavoidable problem that you handled effectively, instead of as a mistake you made that means they can’t rely on you.

Remember that you have the most end-to-end context on the project, which means you should be the least scared of scary changes. Everyone else is dealing with more unknowns and is going to be even less keen to pull the big lever. (If there’s some other engineer who is across all of this who you’re waiting for, bad news: they’re probably the one actually shipping your project).

**Aim to become more employable**  
Given that, for now I would recommend focusing on the fundamentals: i.e. becoming the kind of engineer companies want to bring in and retain. Get really good at shipping. Delivering projects makes you more secure at your current company and gives you nice bullet points for your resume at the same time. Try to make sure you remain technically strong, particularly in growing areas.
