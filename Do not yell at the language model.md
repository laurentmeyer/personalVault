An AI language model is an _area in personality space_ (For much more on this, see [here](https://www.seangoedecke.com/ai-personality-space)). That is, in order to generate plausible language, it contains a fuzzy persona in its world-model. You might think of that persona as “the kind of person who might say these things” - typically a chipper, helpful, politically correct assistant. Many of those attributes are locked in during the post-training, but you can still shift that persona a little bit by the way you talk to the model. If you talk in a highly-technical way, the model will be technical right back at you. If you talk in a colloquial way, the model will match your vibe.

This process is self-reinforcing. Because the model is simply predicting the next sentence in the conversation, previous messages that the model has sent have a lot of influence over the next message it sends. If the model called you “bro” before, it’s much more likely to call you “bro” now[2](https://www.seangoedecke.com/do-not-yell-at-the-language-model/?utm_source=seangoedecke&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=do-not-yell-at-the-language-model-2d33#fn-2). More worryingly, **if the model made a visible mistake before, it’s more likely to make a visible mistake now**. The fact that it made a previous mistake is pushing it away from the “competent assistant” area in personality space and towards the “incompetent assistant” one.

So what should you do when an AI model makes a big mistake? I recommend correcting it as matter-of-factly as possible and trying to briskly move on. If you haven’t yet built up a lot of context in the conversation, it might be worth starting over entirely. The best approach - only offered by some AI tools - is to go back to the point in the conversation right before the mistake was made and head it off by updating your previous message.
